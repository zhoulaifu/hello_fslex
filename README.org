The repo consists in a .NET Core project. It is a minimal work example
for a lexer specification in fslex. I use dotnet to
automate the build process.


* Files

- hello_fslex.fsl: the lexer spec
- hello_fslex.fsproj: the project file of the .Net Core project


* Prerequisite

- dotnet
- fslexyacc (installed via nuget)

* How to generate the lexer

- dotnet build

It is likely that you need to adjust the project file to your system.


* How to run the lexer

- dotnet run

The step subsumes the previous one. It also runs the generated lexer,
which takes a single digit from stdin.

Tested on an Mac OS.
